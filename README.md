# Suicide-Rate-Analysis

This project aims to investigate patterns in global suicide rates across various cohorts and socioeconomic backgrounds using exploratory data analysis. Given the alarming statistic that nearly 800,000 people die by suicide annuallyâ€”approximately one person every 40 seconds, this study seeks to identify effective, evidence-based interventions at different population levels by analyzing data on suicide rates from 1985 to 2016.
